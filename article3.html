                <h1>What is Neapolitan pizza?</h1>
                <div class="article_text">
                    <h2>RECENTLY, EVERYONE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT NEAPOLITAN PIZZA HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE. AND SHE MOVED THE TRADITIONAL PIZZA. WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HER?</h2>
                    <p>Neapolitan pizza, as the name suggests, appeared in Naples. It is considered that the birthplace of pizza as a product is Naples, where pizza appeared around the end of the XV century. The well-known pizza "Margarita" made of tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil was born thanks to the love of Maria Carolina of Habsburg-Lorraine for this dish in the 19th century. In Naples, pizza is made almost at every step, there are several pizzerias that are more than 100 years old and where recipes are passed down from generation to generation.

                        The standards of Neapolitan pizza are very strict. In order for the pizzeria to have the status of Neapolitan in 1984, a special association was created in Naples â€“ Associazione Verace Pizza napoletana (AVPN), whose purpose is to preserve and spread the traditions of cooking real Neapolitan pizza.
                        
                        The Association assigns the status of VERA PIZZA to pizzerias that prepare Neapolitan pizza in accordance with approved standards. There are a lot of standards in the document, but I will highlight the most important ones that we especially respect in our pizzerias.</p>
                    <h2>1. FLOUR</h2>
                    <p>For the preparation of the dough, only Italian flour from soft wheat varieties is suitable, in the production of which wheat kernels are used, with a high content of proteins and starch (grinding "00") and flour strength W 320-360. This type of flour is most suitable for a long "maturation" of the dough, the fermentation process makes it easier and more useful.</p>
                    <h2>2. DOUGH</h2>
                    <p>As in the homeland of pizza, in Naples, we use only flour, water, salt and yeast to prepare the dough and do not use sugar, fat, eggs and various impurities. Before using the dough to make pizza, we keep it for at least 24 hours. During this time, complex chemical processes occur: under the action of enzymes, proteins and starch are broken down, and carbon dioxide released during fermentation loosens the dough. Thanks to this, pizza becomes light, less caloric and is better absorbed by the body.</p>
                    <h2>3. HANDMADE</h2>
                    <p>Pizzaiolo can only work with their hands.  Forming the basis of the future pizza, the pizzaiolo manually gives it a shape, while it is impossible to use dough-rolling machines and rolling pins. This is necessary so as not to disrupt the structure of the dough, but to shift carbon dioxide from the center of the pizza to the edge so that the side when baking turns out to be airy and soft. This is a very complex and fascinating process.</p>
                    <h2>4. WOOD-BURNING STOVE</h2>
                    <p>For the preparation of Neapolitan pizza, you can use only a wood-burning oven and a live fire. This is the tradition. The wood-burning stove withstands high temperature loads, heated air masses circulate inside it from the bottom up, which ensures fast and high-quality pizza preparation. At the same time, the pizza is baked due to two different processes: the pizza base is baked by heating the hearthstone, and the filling is baked using infrared radiation from the fire. It is very difficult to catch the temperature balance, especially when the temperature in the oven reaches 450 degrees Celsius, and the pizza is baked for 60-90 seconds.</p>
                    <h2>5. PRODUCTS</h2>
                    <p>To prepare pizza according to standards, you can use only certain products. We use the best of them: Molino DallaGiovanna flour, approved by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, Fior di Latte mozzarella, which has a shelf life of only 7 days, and pelati tomatoes without preservatives and dyes.
