                    <h2>Convenient location, small terrace and delicious pizza: review of the new pizzeria Roni</h2>
                    <p>The pizzeria is located at Istikbol, 8. The cafe itself is not so large, the summer terrace has not yet been fully opened, since the construction of the neighboring building has not yet been completed, and this construction does not allow opening a large summer terrace. Now the summer terrace is very small and closed from all sides, but smoking, for example, is only possible there. Inside the pizzeria there is a very cozy, calm atmosphere. The cafe opened just a week ago, and there is simply no end of guests. Later in the evening, I advise you to book a table in advance. The waiters are friendly, polite and attentive, the only thing they don't have time for is a large flow of people.</p>
                    <h2>Parmegiano\strachatella</h2>
                    <p>I'll tell you a little about Neapolitan pizza. The main difference of the Neapolitan pizza is its base, the diameter of which is approximately 25.5 centimeters. Classic Neapolitan pizza is small in size and thin in the middle, but thick at the edges. This Neapolitan yummy is created exclusively in a wood-burning oven. The menu is not so big, but original, non-standard. My choice fell on three types at once: Star, Three cheeses and Parmegiano/strachatella. I will describe the basis of pizza to begin with, since it is the same in all types.
                    The composition of this pizza includes pilati tomatoes (these are peeled tomatoes preserved in their own juice), basil, eggplant, strachatella (in the original, cheese made from Italian buffalo milk), parmesan and garlic. I haven't tried eggplant pizza before, but it turned out to be really delicious. The strachatella was fresh and not too bland.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Three cheeses</h2>
                    <p>This pizza already lacks tomato sauce, the whole pizza filling consists only of cheese. The pizza consists of mozzarella, cream cheese, gorgonzola and basil. To begin with, the whole trick is to add gorgonzola cheese, namely mold. This is an Italian cheese, it belongs to blue cheeses. This cheese is not added in large quantities, because it would be impossible to eat pizza because of the oversaturation of the product. The pizza was spicy and different from many others.</p>
